## Prompt 2: The 1 Billion Row Challenge

The second challenge is to implement a solution to the [1 billion row challenge](https://1brc.dev/). This means writing a program that reads temperature measurements and calculates the min, max, and mean temperature at each weather station. 

You can find the challenge at [this repository](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/tree/main). In that repository, there is a python program to create the measurement file. We encourage you to start with a smaller number of measurements than 1 billion. 

Try out different optimizations: parallelization, aggregation, distribution, perhaps even GPUization!
