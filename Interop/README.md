## Prompt 5: C+Chapel Interoperability

The fifth challenge uses Chapel's C interoperability features to write a Chapel program that makes calls to the Rebound library, a library for N-body simulations. 

#### Prerequisite: Clone and Build the Rebound Library

To continue with this challenge, you will need to download and build the `rebound.o` shared library. The following sequence of commands should suffice:
```
git clone https://github.com/hannorein/rebound.git
cd rebound/src
make
```
